//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Up", "Tangled", "Toy Story"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movie1 = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let last = movies[movies.length - 1]

console.log(movies)
console.log(movie1)
console.log(len)
console.log(last)
